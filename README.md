# Sinatra API Backend Starter Code

## Usage

- Build a web basic API with Sinatra and Active Record to support a React
  frontend

## Introduction

The focus of this starter code is **building a Sinatra API backend** that uses
**Active Record** to access and persist data in a database, which will be used
by a separate **React frontend** that interacts with the database via the API.

## Common Requirements for a Sinatra API application

- Use Active Record to interact with a database.
- Have a minimum of two models with a one-to-many relationship.
- Create API routes in Sinatra that handles at least three different CRUD
  actions for at least one of your Active Record models.
- Build a separate React frontend application that interacts with the API to
  perform CRUD actions.
- Use good OO design patterns. You should have separate classes for each of your
  models, and create instance and class methods as necessary.

For example, build a todo list application with a React frontend interface and a
Sinatra backend API, where a user can:

- **Create** a new todo
- **Read** a list of all todos
- **Update** an individual todo
- **Delete** a todo

A `Todo` can be tagged with a `Category`, so that each todo _belongs to_ a
category and each category _has many_ todos.

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup

This repository has all the starter code needed to get a Sinatra backend up and
running. [**Fork and clone**][fork link] this repository to get started. Then, run
`bundle install` to install the gems.

[fork link]: https://github.com/Huulamnguyen/sinatra-api-backend-starter-code

The `app/controllers/application_controller.rb` file has an example GET route
handler. Replace this route with routes for your project.

You can start your server with:

```console
$ bundle exec rake server
```

This will run your server on port
[http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292).

### Frontend Setup

Your backend and your frontend should be in **two different repositories**.

Create a new repository in a **separate folder** with a React app for your
frontend. `cd` out of the backend project directory, and use
[create-react-app][] to generate the necessary code for your React frontend:

```console
$ npx create-react-app my-app-frontend
```

After creating the project locally, you should also
[create a repository on GitHub][create repo] to host your repo and help
collaborate, if you're working with a partner.

### Fetch Example

Your React app should make fetch requests to your Sinatra backend! Here's an
example:

```js
fetch("http://localhost:9292/test")
  .then((r) => r.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```
